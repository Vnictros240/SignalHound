# 🧠 AI-Enabled Cyber Research Engine (codename: SignalHound)

````markdown
> A system that manually (and later automatically) scrapes + summarizes problems from Red Teamers in real-time.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a research system that identifies and summarizes *real-world problems* faced by penetration testers and Red Teamers by collecting and analyzing content from public platforms. Begin with a **manual process** to verify patterns and output quality, then evolve into a fully automated system.

**Outcome:**  
Weekly insights like:  
**“Top 10 Red Team frustrations this week”** → Fuel content creation, tooling ideas, product strategy, and thought leadership.

## 🛠️ Manual Implementation Plan (Phase 1)

### 📥 Step 1: Manual Data Collection (Weekly)
Scrape **problem-rich content** from the following platforms:

#### 🔸 Reddit
- Target Subreddits:
  - `r/netsec`, `r/redteamsec`, `r/AskNetsec`, `r/cybersecurity`, `r/ReverseEngineering`
- Manual Process:
  - Search via Reddit or Google:
    ```
    site:reddit.com/r/netsec "problem" OR "issue" OR "frustrating"
    ```
  - Read posts from the past 7 days
  - Copy content into a research note or Airtable row

#### 🔸 GitHub
- Target:
  - Issues and Discussions in Red Team tool repos:
    - BloodHound, Sliver, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Mythic
- Manual Process:
  - Visit `Issues` tab and filter by:
    - Labels: `bug`, `feature request`, `question`
    - Open issues in last 14 days
  - Copy any post that describes a pain point into your research doc

#### 🔸 Twitter/X
- Search Hashtags:
  - `#redteam`, `#pentesting`, `#offsec`, `#bugbounty`
- Manual Process:
  - Use advanced search:
    ```
    ("hate when" OR "sucks that" OR "why doesn't") (#redteam OR #pentesting)
    ```
  - Screenshot or copy text of valid tweets

#### 🔸 Conference CFP Pages
- Target:
  - DEF CON, Black Hat, BSides, Hack in the Box, Wild West Hackin’ Fest
- Manual Process:
  - Look at CFP descriptions and talk abstracts
  - Look for any “pain-motivated” talk titles like:
    - “Lessons learned from a failed op”
    - “Why red team reporting is broken”

### ✍️ Step 2: Human Tagging & Summarization

For each collected post or issue:

| Field | Manual Task |
|-------|-------------|
| `Problem Summary` | Summarize in 1–2 sentences |
| `Source Type` | Label as `Reddit`, `GitHub`, `Twitter`, `Conference` |
| `Source Link` | Add original URL |
| `Category` | Choose from: `Tooling`, `Process`, `Recon`, `EDR`, `Payload`, `Reporting` |
| `Keywords` | Extract recurring terms (tools, platforms, errors) |
| `Date` | Add scrape date |

Use Airtable, Notion table, or Obsidian-style markdown:

```markdown
## 🧠 Problem Summary
> BloodHound SharpHound crashes on AD forests with >50k users.

- Source: GitHub Issue
- Link: https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/issues/123
- Category: Tooling
- Keywords: BloodHound, crash, Active Directory
- Date: 2025-07-01

| Twitter scraper      | `Tweepy` or `snscrape`                       |
| CFP monitor          | HTML scraper / RSS reader                    |
| Sentiment classifier | OpenAI + LangChain                           |
| Topic tagger         | LLM prompt or fine-tuned classifier          |
| Weekly summarizer    | GPT-4 + cron job                             |
| Export pipeline      | Notion API, Airtable API, Markdown generator |
